# AoE-Department-Project

This repository contains the code, resources, and products involved in the department project for computer science.

1) index.ipynb contains the code responsible for generating the graphs charting the relative rates of prescriptions vs. deaths
      two.txt and three.txt are the raw data for this operation
  
2) The two .png files are the maps that display the geographic representations of the deaths and prescriptions
      The two maps are accompanied by their respective building code
     
3) correlation.py runs a series of analysis to determine if there is any discernable correlation between the two data sets
      It is accompanied by its relevent raw data, "OpiodDeaths.txt" and "prescriptions.tsv"
